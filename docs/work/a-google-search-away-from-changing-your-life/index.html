  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    The Dominican Republic It's the second biggest island in the Caribbean, with 10,648,791 people. According to the last census, wealth in D.R. is distributed across four social classes; high class 6%, middle-high class 17%, middle class 20%, Low class 47%, and poverty 10% this means that more than half the population (57%) live below human standards.

  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    Nowadays, the internet is part of our society, and it seems that it doesn't matter how much you earn; everyone
    appears to need a source of connection to the internet. But, internet plans are expensive and, in the Dominican
    Republic, you don't find any open Wi-Fi-connections.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    Claro, which is the biggest telecommunications company in the Dominican Republic, sized up a business opportunity by creating an inexpensive internet plan, so their team designed an Internet Plan with a download speed of 512kbps for a USD 5.99 monthly contract.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__quote">
    My role in this project was UX Researcher along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bedalinda/" target="new">Bedalinda M. Peguero</a> in a team of 11 talents.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">HYPOTHESIS</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    Our first impression was that 512kbps seemed to be ridiculously slow; today's websites demand a higher bandwidth
    speed to make the most straightforward tasks.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    We observed cultural behavior and noticed that low-class users, despite their income, were hugely influenced
    socially by the internet. The internet has a significant impact on how they see entertainment and education.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__quote">
    "We want to improve people's lives, not slow them down."
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    But a slow cheap internet connection is better than nothing?

  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    We found out that 76% of users do not have internet at their homes. So, how do they use the internet at all?
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    Well, in low-class communities, there are a few businesses called "Cybercafe," they are businesses that rent the internet and charge users per hour of usage. It's usually filled with game consoles, T.V.'s, and computers, the price may vary from USD 0.30 to USD 0.50 per hour depending on if you're renting a console or just a computer.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    And yes, they are paying rent per hour to play online video games.
  </p>

    <img src="/assets/images/case-2/World Cyber Games.jpg?v=2.0" alt="Cyber" />
  </div>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    Considering that the average speed on the Cybercafe is 30mbps, is 512kbps enough? We made a controlled experiment with 12 users and asked them to do things they usually do on a computer but, without telling them we throttled the speed to 512kbps.

  </picture>
  <p class="work-post-content__quote">
    512kbps is not enough; it will be better to keep using the Cybercafe.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    "512kbps is the minimum speed for the internet to do something. And it is a frustrating experience in a world that
    goes at the speed of light."
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    Because of the "Cybercafe" experience, their mental model demands a higher internet speed.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    So, if 512kbps is not enough, what will be enough? Let's enlist the numerous websites the users visit and talk to
    the big brothers. What is the minimum speed for an optimal experience for them?

    We were sad to found that these kids and young adults saw the internet as an entertainment tool. The internet can be
    a powerful learning tool and even creates job opportunities.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    The internet can be an opportunity for a better life. We should not only bring a higher internet speed at an
    affordable price to our users but to repurpose its meaning in the head of our user.

    Let's do this. It's time for the communication team to join us. These were the results:

  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    We manage to convince Claro to lower the price of Mbps when the speed was below a certain point, and we end up
    building an internet of 2mbps for USD 2.
  </p>

  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
    Also, the communications team worked from our investigation and insights and built a campaign educating fathers and
    children about how the internet can improve their lives.
