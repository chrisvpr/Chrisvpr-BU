    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        A while ago, I moved in with my girlfriend, who is a professional photographer and a photography teacher.
        Naturally,we started working together in the same house office, and our workflows began to blend.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        As a creative problem solver, I began to identify frustrations in her workflow, mainly in the pre-selection
        stage of the journey.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">Over time I began to see those same frustrations in the flows of her
        colleagues and students, igniting an idea to be born.</p>
    <img data-src="/assets/images/case-4/case-4-class.png" alt="Class" class="work-post-content__image" width="500">
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">THE PROBLEM</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Some of the popular top-notch solutions on photography workflows weren't available in our country (Dominican
        Republic) because of region restrictions, leading to piracy and a lot of frustrations.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Other solutions were too expensive or weren't able to handle fast RAW image processing, directly impacting user
        experience.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">THE OPPORTUNITY</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        I met with a few old colleagues, and we discussed this bold idea of creating a free open source project to help
        photography students and side-hustler photographers.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        With no hesitation, They jumped in, and we immediately started working.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__quote">
        My role in the team was Product Designer.

    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title"></p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Workflows vary depending on the experience of each photographer, but they all have 5 phases in
        common:Negotiation, Production, Pre-Selection, Selection, and Post-production.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Photographers shape their workflow based on the tools they have, not vice versa. 62.3% of those
        interviewed have had to download some software illegally due to region restrictions.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Raw Image processing speed was a common issue in most of the apps tested on the competitive
        analysis.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">DEFINE AND IDEATE:</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We focused our scope in the Pre-Selections phase, because of the number of frustrations and lack of solutions
        out there, and concluded that it will have a higher impact on the shortest development cycle.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        After some Affinity Mapping, we built 1 user persona that represented all frustrations and pain-points of the
        users we interviewed.

            alt="Research Plan">
    </picture>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We then began our 5 day design sprint, where we managed to include a wide range of photographers and our
        technical and design team.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        In those 5 days, we spent some time in lightning talks and HMW exercises, We iterated our user
        persona through a new affinity mapping session and dot voting and we ended up our week building our User
        Journey.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We designed a low fidelity prototype, and it was ready for some usability testing.</p>

    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">ATTEMPT 1:</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The first attempt did not go as expected. Users were overwhelmed with all the options and were easily confused,
        leading to a lot of wasted time.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        After analyzing feedback and a lot of thinking, we designed our second prototype.</p>

    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">ATTEMPT 2:</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        This time we focused on the experience of the main journey and moved non-commonly used features to the options
        tab.
        We also switched to a more minimal UI.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The results were fantastic and very positive, with some minor fixes and improvements.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">FINAL DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We prioritized the work using an MVP design matrix and added context-based features like asking if users wanted
        to import new images if they connected their camera or SD card to the computer.</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We also put some hard work to have a higher RAW processing speed than our competitors. These were the results of
        a snowball sampling control experiment testing, analyzing results using ANOVA.</p>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We started thinking about the brand immediately after the first wave of research. Taking inspiration from one of
        our developers, who is learning to speak Japanese, we end up with the word Erabo which literally translates into
        Choose,but also has a powerful cultural meaning:

    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">RESULTS</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We learned a lot from this project, from new research techniques to new agile work methodologies, and we are
        excited by all the positive comments we have received.

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We want to make a real community-driven apps ecosystem; we want photographers all over the world to join our
        community and get involved in ideas for new products, feedback, and testing.

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We want the new versions of Erabo Pre-Selector and the other products to be designed and developed by the new
        members that are joining this project.
