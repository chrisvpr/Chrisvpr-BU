</div>

<div class="work-post-content">
  <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">Where it all Began</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">25 years old. Born and raised in Dominican Republic, a developing country
    in the middle of the Caribbean. Because of this we developed a mastery in problem-solving, having to come up with
    unique ways to solve the most basic tasks on hand. Research, Design, Prototype, and testing play a fundamental part
    of our culture.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">When I was eight, I used to play with legos all day. I was terrific; I
    used to build big towers, bridges, and cars. My mother divorced, and we began living with her best friend and her
    two children, one of them had a disability and needed a wheelchair.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">One evening we were playing pretending the wheelchair was a sport car,
    which resulted in a broken wheel. The wheelchair didn’t even budge. To avoid getting us in trouble, and to help him
    move again, I rapidly studied the broken piece, grabbed some legos and tape, and made a quick fix. The first attempt
    was unsuccessful, but I changed a few times until it worked again.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">After that day, I started to develop the discipline of prototyping and
    experimentation with the end goal of helping people.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">Today, I help people through user experience design, but tomorrow, it
    could be anything similar or maybe totally different.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">What I love to do</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm"> I love making people from different backgrounds to work together and
    create things; I participated and facilitated numerous online and remote<a class="work-post-content__link"
      target="new" href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">
      design sprints</a> workshops and got certified in <a class="work-post-content__link" target="new"

    acquiring deep understanding of the Agile methodology.
  </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">The most powerful skill I have is the ability to learn new things quickly
    and teach others. I love to share and get knowledge through <a class="work-post-content__link" target="new"
      href="/keynote-2/"> Sharing
      Sessions, Workshops, Keynotes,</a> a or just having meaningful conversations.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">The Humans that shaped my career </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm"><a class="work-post-content__link" target="new"
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilguareno/"><strong>Emil
        Guareño</strong></a> (Sr Software Engineer @ Disney ): In just one Summer, of all the things I learned, he
    introduced me to the world of programming, teaching me how developers solve problems in a very creative way. After
    he was gone, I learned web development myself, idealizing my problem-solving skills with the understanding of
    technology.
