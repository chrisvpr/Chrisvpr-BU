      <p> With a natural talent for empathy building and passion for technology, I started my journey with the idea that
        I can change how the word is design for the better. My goal is to place the user at the center of every
        experience, adding value to their lives.</p>

      <p>I worked as a User Experience Designer for several years, idealizing my creative problem-solving skills using
        research and data. Also, I used to collaborate on open-source projects, the last one being 
        <a href="https://erabo.app/" class="bio-description__link" target="new">
          Erabo App </a>.</p>

      <p>Today, as the Director of User Experience at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grupo-pe%C3%B1a-defill%C3%B3-34aa79162/" class="bio-description__link" target="new">
        Peña Defilló</a>, I run a small multidisciplinary team called
        <a href="https://www.digitas.com/en-us" class="bio-description__link" target="new">
          Digitas</a>, that designs, builds, and scale digital products. </p>
