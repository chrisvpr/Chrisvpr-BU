<div class="work-post-content">
  <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">Where it all Began</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">I am 25 years old and was born and raised in the Dominican Republic, a
    developing country in the middle of the Caribean. Because of constraints, Dominicans are masters in problem-solving,
    having to come up with unique ways to solve the most basic tasks on hand. Research, Design, Prototype, and testing
    play a fundamental part of our culture.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">When I was eight, I used to play with legos all-day. I was terrific; I
    used to build big towers, bridges, and cars. My mother was divorced, and we used to live with her best friend and
    her two children, one of them was in a wheelchair.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">One evening, We were playing pretending the wheelchair was a sports car
    resulting in the breaking of a little piece of it, and, suddenly, the wheels were braked and stop moving. To avoid
    trouble, and to help him to move in his wheelchair again, I rapidly study the broken pice, grab some legos and tape,
    and make a quick fix, it did not work the first time, but I change it a few times until it worked again.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">After that day, I started to develop the discipline of prototyping and
    experimentation with the end goal of helping people. </p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">Today, I help people thought user experience design, but tomorrow, it
    could be anything similar or maybe totally different.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">What I love to do</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm"> I love to make people from different backgrounds to work together and
    create things; I facilitated and participated in numerous online and remote <a class="work-post-content__link"
      target="new" href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">
      design sprints</a> workshops and got certified in <a class="work-post-content__link" target="new"

    for a deep understanding of the Agile way of working.</p>
  <p class="work-post-content__paragraph --sm">The most powerful skill I have is the ability to learn new things very
    fast and to teach others. I love to share and get knowledge through <a class="work-post-content__link" target="new"
      href="/keynote-2/"> Sharing
      Sessions, Workshops, Keynotes,</a> a or just having meaningful conversations.</p>

    technology.</p>
