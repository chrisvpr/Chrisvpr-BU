        Where it all Began
      </p>
      <p class="bio__section-body">
        Born and raised in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic" class="bio__link"
          target="new">Dominican Republic</a> , a developing country in the middle of the Caribbean.
        Because of this we developed a mastery in problem-solving, having to come up with unique ways to solve the most
        basic tasks at hand. Research, Design, Prototype, and testing play a fundamental part of our culture.
      </p>
      <p class="bio__section-body">
        When I was eight, I used to play with legos all day. I was terrific; I used to build big towers, bridges, and
        cars. My mother got divorced, and we began living with her best friend and her two children, one of them had a
        disability and needed a wheelchair.
      </p>
      <p class="bio__section-body">
        One evening we were playing, we pretended the wheelchair was a sports car, which resulted in us breaking a
        wheel.The wheelchair wouldn't even budge. To avoid getting us in trouble, and to help the kid be able to move
        around
        in his wheelchair again, I fastly studied the broken piece, grabbed some legos and tape, and made a quick fix.
        The
        first attempt was unsuccessful, but I kept changing it until it worked again.
      </p>
      <p class="bio__section-body">
        After that day, I started to develop the discipline of prototyping and experimentation with the end goal of
        helping people.

        What I love to do
      </p>
      <p class="bio__section-body">
        I love gathering people from different backgrounds and make them work together and create things; I participated
        and facilitated
        numerous online and remote <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" class="bio__link" target="new">design sprint</a>
        workshops and got <a

          class="bio__link" target="new">certified in Agile SaFe,</a> acquiring a deep
        understanding of the Agile methodology.
      </p>
      <p class="bio__section-body">
        The most powerful skill I have is the ability to learn new things quickly and teach others. I love to share and
        get knowledge through <a href="/keynotes/" class="bio__link" target="new">Sharing Sessions, Workshops,
          Keynotes</a> or just having meaningful conversations.
