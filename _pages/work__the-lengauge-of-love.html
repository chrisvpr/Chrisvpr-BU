        When we think of the word "translation" many images can come to mind: The typical copy and paste in Google
        Translator, the subtitles of our favorite series, the voiceover of cartoons, or the guide of our last excursion
        in an unknown country; to name a few.

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Two people want to have a conversation, but neither can speak the other's language. Using an application, what
        would be the best experience to transcribe, translate, and listen to what the other party says?

        This research is about understanding the big picture: considering the industry landscape, user needs and a
        client’s business imperatives.

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        I had a virtual coffee with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/celeste-p%C3%A9rez/"
            class="bio-description__link" target="new">Celeste Pérez</a> , facilitator at the <a
            href="https://www.icda.edu.do/" class="bio-description__link" target="new">Dominican-American cultural
            institute</a>, an organization dedicated to bilingual learning. My goal is to know the best way to study the
        interaction between 2 people who do not speak the same language, to discover problems and turn them into
        opportunities.
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        After a 2 hour conversation, we came to the following conclusion: The best way is to observe romantic dates. Romantic dates? Yes.
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Celeste points me to a study she conducted in July 2019, titled <a
            href="https://listindiario.com/las-sociales/2019/07/19/574697/interpretacion-susurrada-sabes-de-que-se-trata"
            class="bio-description__link" target="new">"whispered interpretation."</a> I discovered that translation is
        nothing more than comparing semantic definitions of two languages; it's cold, logical, and without any feelings.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__quote">
        On the other hand, Interpretation first understands the content and then paraphrases it under the listener's
        cultural context; conveys emotions and tone; It is not about "what is being said" but about "how it is being
        said."
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Since I cannot recreate a political negotiation, another perfect landscape is to observe romantic dates between
        two people who do not speak the same language; in these scenarios, many critical elements of communication could
        participate: expressions, stories of the past, present, and future, descriptions, instructions, directions,
        negotiations, lies, etc. Everything that could go wrong in translating a conversation will go wrong on a
        romantic date.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        To quickly test this hypothesis, I decided to run a controlled experiment of a date between 2 people who cannot
        speak the same language, in this case, English and Spanish.
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Taking inspiration from the prologue of the <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/User-Experience-Design-Challenge-gypVVpnAEr5Um8owJnXy3" target="new" class="bio-description__link">design challenge</a> , we gave each participant a walkie-talkie. We have
        an interpreter; when one person speaks on a walkie-talkie, it will reach the interpreter, who will respond to
        the other on his walkie-talkie in his or her language and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The results were incredible. We confirmed the hypothesis and created the perfect scenario to test a prototype
        after the application is ready.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        A quick finding was that the improvised interpreter (myself) had a lot of trouble translating contextual
        language jokes and other cultural expressions. Another impressive result was that it was very uncomfortable (and
        funny) for our English speaker to hear my voice instead of a woman's voice.

        I searched for English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French speakers to try to achieve a more diverse research. I

        SYNTHESIS:
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Now is the time to listen, and translate, the interviews. At this stage, I usually like to include different
        team members in a workshop format, but this time, I modified the process to do it alone.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        While listening to the interviews, I synthesized some critical points on a wall of digital post-its and did some affinity mapping.
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">
        KEY FINDINGS:
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        1. Popular applications like "Google Translate," "iTranslate," and "SayHi" cannot reproduce the tone. According
        to users, it is challenging to interpret tone when they have to hear two voices in the same conversation.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        2. Hearing an unnatural or even a robotic voice adds distance to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        3. Cultural aspects are fundamental, and it is impossible to translate expressions that require a linguistic
        context such as jokes or sayings.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        5. It will be beneficial to add different languages based on cultural expressions. For Example, Latin America Spanish is a very abstract concept considering that a word in Colombia, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Ecuador could mean something very different.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        I decided to tackle real-time conversation translation. If I solve this problem, the rest will be more
        straightforward.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title" id="ideation">
        IDEATION:
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Considering the user's opportunities and frustrations, I began to sketch different solutions with pencil and
        paper. In this case, the fastest, and most human interface will succeed. I made other
        paper options and quickly tested them until I ended with a balance where design decisions were significant.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The mental model of users influenced familiarity to win over innovation in terms of the user interface.
    </p>
    <img data-src="/assets/images/case-5/map.png" class="work-post-content__image" alt="Flow Map">
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        But I want the product to be the interpreter among many translators. For that to occur, I still have to solve a
        significant problem and go beyond the interface: Voice and Tone.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        While ideating solutions about tone, an idea struck me: What if the translated voice in the application was the
        same sound and tone of the input? That is, if I use the translator from English to Italian, it will be my same
        voice and tone, but in Italian. Is that even possible?
    </p>
    
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title" id="tech">
        TECHNICAL CHALLENGE:
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        For this particular case, I did not have a technical team by my side to answer those matters. So after a bit of
        desktop research, I came across two companies: <a href="https://www.resemble.ai/" class="bio-description__link" target="new">Resemble.ai </a>   and  <a href="https://utopia.ai/" class="bio-description__link" target="new">Utopia.ai</a> ; both companies, can create a digital
        voice model based on the recorded voices of real people.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The question would be: With input in one language, could AI generate output in another language?
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        So, I interviewed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saqib-muhammad-6b324825/" class="bio-description__link" target="new">Saqib Muhammad </a>, Engineer, and co-founder of Resemble.ai, to see if he can answer my technical
        ambitions.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Here a short highlight of the interview:
    </p>
    <video width="400" controls>
        <source src="/assets/images/case-5/interview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The short answers are Yes and No.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        It is possible to generate a voice model in one language from another language, but it is impossible to do it
        real-time. 45min of audio is required for it to create expressions translated from one language to another.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        What about the tone? Yes, it is possible to capture the tone in real-time using Resemble AI algorithms. I could
        place a translated voice much more natural and with the same tone of the speaking person. If we can capture and
        reproduce the "how it says it" beyond the "what it says," we will have a real competitive advantage.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        There are different technical possibilities: Pre-record sounds of voices of other models. The system
        could search for the closest match to that of the user (in terms of sound) and add the tone using Resemble tone
        matching algorithms. Another alternative is to build standard sound models and only identify the tone patterns.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        There is a long technical and usability road left, but we verify that the general concept is possible. To
        continue with this exercise, I will assume that we will have an application that can translate the input voice
        into a similar output matching the speaker's tone.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title" id="proto">
        PROTOTYPE (LOW-FI):
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        I turned the wireframes into a prototype and tested them with real users. And you guest it: I tested the
        prototype with romantic dates between our participants.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The prototype received five rounds of iterations to reach its current state. We had to combine test sessions
        with interpreters to mimic the technology of voice tone and sound.

    </a>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">    
        I created a familiar interface where users can see visually the two languages that the app is going to
        interpret. Users can change languages by tapping on the name of the language.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The mic button can be pressed to detect either language. when the users stop speaking the app will read the
        translated text in a similar voice and tone of the input voice. Users can opt to write the text they want to
        translate.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Users can view the conversation history, copy texts and report misinterpretations to help improve our AI
        algorithm.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        In the user icon, users can download languages to be used offline, manage their settings, and view the general
        app information. Users can opt for a more variety of a Language like Colombian Spanish or Haitian French.
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">
        FINAL THOUGHTS:
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Olá Unbabeler! I put a lot of work, love, and coffee into this test. So any kind of feedback is more than
        welcome.
    </p>

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        In a real scenario, I would have more time to find a better user profile, a quantitative study, data analysis, a
        business context and objectives, etc; probably resulting in a very different product. However, I tried to
        encapsulate various design decisions so you could understand my way of thinking and a bit of my process.

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you soon at the office.
