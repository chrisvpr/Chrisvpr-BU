    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      The Dominican Republic It’s the second biggest island in the Caribbean
      with 10.77 million people (2017). According to the last census, Wealth
      in D.R. is distributed across 4 social classes: high class 6%,
      middle-high class 17%, middle class 20%, Low class 47% and indigence
      10%. This means that more than half the population (57%) live below
      human standards.

    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      Nowadays, the Internet is embedded in our society and, it seems that it
      doesn't matter how much you earn, everyone appears to need a source of
      connection to the internet. But, internet plans are expensive and, in
      the Dominican Republic, you don't find any open Wi-Fi connections.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      Claro, which is the biggest telecommunications company in the Dominican
      Republic, detected a business opportunity by creating an inexpensive
      internet plan, so their team design an Internet Plan with a download
      speed of 512kbps for a $5.99 USD a month contract.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">CULTURAL CONTEXT</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      Our first impression was that 512kbps seems to be ridiculously slow,
      today's websites demand a higher bandwidth speed to make the easiest
      tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      We observed cultural behavior and noticed that low-class users, despite
      their income, were socially influenced by the internet. The Internet has
      a huge impact on how they see entertainment and education.

      "We want to improve people's lives, not slow them down"
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      But a slow cheap internet connection is better than nothing, right?

    <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">KEY FINDING</p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      We also found out that 76% of users do not have internet in their homes
      or smartphones. So, how do they use the internet at all?
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      Well, in low-class communities there are a few businesses called Cyber
      Internets, they are business that rent the internet and charge users per
      minutes of usage. It’s usually filled with game consoles, TV’s and
      computers, and the price per hour of the internet may vary from $0.30
      USD to $0.50USD per hour depending if you're renting a console or just a
      computer.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      And yes, they are paying a rent per hour to play online video games.

    </div>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      Considering that the average speed on the Cyber Internet is 30mbps, is
      512kbps enough?
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      We made a controlled experiment with 12 users and ask them to do the
      things they usually do on a computer but, without telling the users, we
      throttle the internet to 512kbps.

      "512kbps is not enough, it will be better to keep using the Cyber
      Internets."
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      512kbps is the minimum speed for the internet to do something. And is a
      frustrating experience in a world that goes at the speed of light”
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      Because of the "Cyber Internets" experience, their mental model demands
      a higher internet speed.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      So, if 512 kbps is not enough, what will be enough? Let's enlist the
      most frequent websites the users visit and talk to the big brothers.
      What is the minimum speed for an optimal experience for them?

      We were sad to find that these kids and young adults saw the internet as
      an entertainment tool. The Internet can be a powerful learning tool and
      even creates job opportunities.
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      The internet can be an opportunity for a better life. We should, not
      only bring a higher internet speed at an affordable price to our users
      but to repurpose its meaning in the head of our user.

      Let's do this. It was then time for the communication team to join us.
      These were the results:
    </p>
    <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
      We manage to convince Claro to lower the price of Mbps when the speed
      was below a certain point and we end up building an internet of 2mbps
      for $2USD, also, the communications team worked from our investigation
      and insights and build an ad campaign educating fathers and children
      about how the internet can be used to improve their lives:
