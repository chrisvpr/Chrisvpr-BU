        Designing Internet Plans for Claro in D.R.

      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The Dominican Republic It’s the second biggest island in the Caribbean
        with 10.77 million people (2017). According to the last census, Wealth
        in D.R. is distributed across 4 social classes: high class 6%,
        middle-high class 17%, middle class 20%, Low class 47% and indigence
        10%. This means that more than half the population (57%) live below
        human standards.
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Nowadays, the Internet is embedded in our society and, it seems that it
        doesn't matter how much you earn, everyone appears to need a source of
        connection to the internet. But, internet plans are expensive and, in
        the Dominican Republic, you don't find any open Wi-Fi connections.
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Claro, which is the biggest telecommunications company in the Dominican
        Republic, detected a business opportunity by creating an inexpensive
        internet plan, so their team design an Internet Plan with a download
        speed of 512kbps for a $5.99 USD a month contract.
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__sub-title">CULTURAL CONTEXT</p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Our first impression was that 512kbps seems to be ridiculously slow,
        today's websites demand a higher bandwidth speed to make the easiest
        tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We observed cultural behavior and noticed that low-class users, despite
        their income, were socially influenced by the internet. The Internet has
        a huge impact on how they see entertainment and education.

        "We want to improve people's lives, not slow them down"

      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        But a slow cheap internet connection is better than nothing, right?

      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We also found out that 76% of users do not have internet in their homes
        or smartphones. So, how do they use the internet at all?
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Well, in low-class communities there are a few businesses called Cyber
        Internets, they are business that rent the internet and charge users per
        minutes of usage. It’s usually filled with game consoles, TV’s and
        computers, and the price per hour of the internet may vary from $0.30
        USD to $0.50USD per hour depending if you're renting a console or just a
        computer.
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        And yes, they are paying a rent per hour to play online video games.

      </div>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Considering that the average speed on the Cyber Internet is 30mbps, is
        512kbps enough?
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        We made a controlled experiment with 12 users and ask them to do the
        things they usually do on a computer but, without telling the users, we
        throttle the internet to 512kbps.

      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        512kbps is the minimum speed for the internet to do something. And is a
        frustrating experience in a world that goes at the speed of light”
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        Because of the "Cyber Internets" experience, their mental model demands
        a higher internet speed.
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        So, if 512 kbps is not enough, what will be enough? Let's enlist the
        most frequent websites the users visit and talk to the big brothers.
        What is the minimum speed for an optimal experience for them?

        We were sad to find that these kids and young adults saw the internet as
        an entertainment tool. The Internet can be a powerful learning tool and
        even creates job opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="work-post-content__paragraph">
        The internet can be an opportunity for a better life. We should, not
        only bring a higher internet speed at an affordable price to our users
        but to repurpose its meaning in the head of our user.

        We manage to convince Claro to lower the price of Mbps when the speed

        for $2USD, also, the communications team worked from our investigation
